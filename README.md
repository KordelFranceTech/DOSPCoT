Dual Observation Self-paced Policy Co-Training

This repository builds off of the work conducted by Ma, et al. (2020) in their original paper of Self-paced Multi-view Co-training (SPaMCo) [1]. It has been adapted to learn a policy for a Markov decision process through reinforcement learning. The foundation of this work was taken from the repository constructed by Ma, et al. below:
